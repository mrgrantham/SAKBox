Added Win64 as a build target. Made all learning models support multi-dimensional labels.
Made learning algorithms automatically handle data type-conversion. (It is no longer necessary

Fixed issues with OSX compatibility. Added lots of comments to make the API docs more complete.
Made GDecisionTree more conformant with the random forest algorithm. Added a recommender system
demo. Added a demo for unsupervised back-prop. Updated GNeuralNet to support the dynamic addition
and removal of nodes. Also added support for custom activation functions. Added a switch to the
learn tool so you can specify which attributes to use for labels, and which attributes to ignore.
Threw out GQueue, GAVLTree, and other classes that were redundant with the STL. (Also threw out
everything that depended on these classes, such as the path-search algorithms and GRelationalTable.
Sorry if you were using those--I think this is good churn, though.) Moved all the classes into
a GClasses namespace. Separated all of the classes not related to machine learning
into a supplemental library called GSup. (That means you now have
to link to two libraries, GClasses and GSup, to get all of my functionality. Again, sorry if this
breaks your code, but I think this is good churn.) Renamed the "categorize" filter to "nominaltocat".
Improved the plot overview tool wrt nominal features. Made GData::determinant more efficient.
Added clarifications to the licenses of the demo apps. Restructured the demo apps to be entirely
contained in a single folder. (This makes them easier to clone.) Rewrote GRand to be inherently 64-bit based.

an uninstall option to the Makefile for Linux. Merged all of the Windows .sln files into a single
monolithic solution that builds everything (to simplify testing). Added the hello_console and hello_web demo apps.
Rewrote the interpolation demo app to show more interpolation and to support more algorithms.
Added random and brute-force optimizers for baseline comparisons. Added a linear programming solver and
a linear regression learner.

	<a href="http://download.famouswhy.com/">FamousWhy</a> gave Waffles the editor's pick
	award. Thanks. Are these awards just attempts by these sites to boost their Google
	rating? I have no idea. I'll let Google sort that out. These guys actually offered to
	perform an interview and write up some tutorials, so it seems that they are willing to
	work for the link.

	<a href="http://www.soft82.com/">Soft82.com</a> gave Waffles the 5-stars award for
	outstanding achievement in the field of excellence. Is this a serious big-deal award?
	I don't know. I can't seem to find a list of other winners anywhere, but I won the
	right to put this nifty logo on my site with a link to their site! It's always nice
	to be acknowledged. Thanks for the award.

ensembles), Random Forest, Arbitrary Arboretum, and PC Forest. Added
some code for computing eigenvectors, an algorithm that computes
principle components of data in many dimensions without needing to

(by generating random numbers with a gaussian distribution). Fixed some
bugs in A-star search, the KNN algorithm, and the Decision Tree class.

<br><br><br><b>2006-08-03</b><br><br>Added A-star search, a relational

GKeyboard.cpp on Windows, that's fixed now.

<br><br><br><b>2006-03-11</b><br><br>
Ported to Mac OSX Tiger. Thanks to Helaman Ferguson for much of this
work. It now works on Mac, Linux, and Windows.

<br><br><br><b>2006-02-25</b><br><br>Added a new efficient
neighbor-finding class. The KNN algorithm is much faster now. Fixed
many bugs. Added a ray-tracing demo. This isn't really related to
machine learning, but I have some plans in the future to try combining
it with learning algorithms to do model reconstruction. The manifold
learning demo demonstrates both unsupervised and semi-supervised
manifold learning now.

<br><br><br><b>2005-12-31</b><br><br>Added a particle swarm algorithm
and some other search algorithms. Fixed some issues with the genetic
algorithm. The Neural Net interpolation demo now compares several
search algorithms. (Backprop is the clear winner, but it's not a
totally fair comparison because backprop is running in incremental mode
while the others are doing batch mode.)

<br><br><br><b>2005-12-17</b><br><br>
This is mostly a bug-fixing release.

<br><br><br><b>2005-12-03</b><br><br>
