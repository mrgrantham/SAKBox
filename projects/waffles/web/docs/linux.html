<h2>Building on Linux</h2>

<p>(If you want to build the bleeding-edge version, click here for <a href="git.html">instructions to get the latest source from our Git repository</a>.)</p>

<ol>
	<li>Install g++ and make (if they are not already installed).<br>
		If you use Debian or Ubuntu, this command will do it:
<pre>
	sudo apt-get install g++ make
</pre>
		If you use Red Hat or Fedora, I think the command is:
<pre>
	sudo yum install g++ make
</pre>

	<br><li>Change to the source folder:
<pre>
	cd waffles/src
</pre>

	<br><li>Next, build and install the Waffles tools:
<pre>
	sudo make install
</pre>
	To uninstall:
<pre>
	sudo make uninstall
</pre>
	If you only want to build optimized binaries, but not install them:
<pre>
	make opt
</pre>

	</li>
	<br><li>There are also some additional tools and demo apps that are not built by default
			because they require some dependency libraries. If you want to build
			these, install:
			<table align=center>
				<tr><td><b><i><u>Debian/Ubuntu</u></i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><b><i><u>Red Hat/Fedora</u></i></b></td></tr>
				<tr><td>libpng12-dev</td><td>libpng-devel</td></tr>
				<tr><td>libjpeg8-dev</td><td>libjpeg-devel</td></tr>
				<tr><td>libsdl1.2-dev</td><td>SDL-devel</td></tr>
				<tr><td>freeglut3-dev</td><td>freeglut-devel</td></tr>
				<tr><td>libx11-dev</td><td>X11-devel</td></tr>
			</table>
	Then, to build the additional tools:
<pre>
	cd waffles/src/depends
	sudo make install
</pre>
	<br>To build the demo apps:
<pre>
	cd waffles/demos
	make opt
</pre>
	(Some of the demos do not require any dependencies. If you prefer, you can install the dependencies only as needed.)
	</li>
</ol>

<br><br><br>
<h2>Using CMake instead of Gnu Make</h2>
<p>If you prefer to use CMake, you can:
	<ol>
		<li>Install CMake. (sudo apt-get install cmake)</li>
		<li>cd waffles/src</li>
		<li>cmake .</li>
		<li>make</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
(Disclaimer: The Waffles developers are currently more familiar with Gnu Make than CMake,
so our CMakeLists.txt files may not be as polished as they should be. For example, they do not
currently install the binaries after building them. If any CMake experts out there want to
help polish these up, that would be appreciated.)</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
	How do I build optimized binaries?
</span><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
	make opt
</div><br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
	How do I build binaries with debug symbols?
</span><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
	make dbg
</div><br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
	I get build errors that look something like this:
	<pre>
		../../obj/GClasses/dbg/GError.d:3: warning: overriding commands for target `GError.o'
		../../obj/GClasses/opt/GError.d:3: warning: ignoring old commands for target `GError.o'
	</pre>
</span><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Try doing "make clean". That always fixes it for me. This is caused by a synchronization issue with generating
	the dependency (.d) files. Unfortunately, the solution would require adding locking mechanisms to the build
	process, which would require additional build dependencies, which would be worse than the problem it solves.
	So, just do "make clean", and the problem will go away.
</div><br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
	Where can I get more specific help?
</span><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
	You can ask a question at our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/waffles/forums">forum</a>. If you
	post a question and you do not get a speedy response, please email me. Sometimes the email that is supposed
	to notify me that there is a new forum post is incorrectly classified as spam and discarded. My email address is on the main page.
</div><br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
	Why isn't Waffles in the apt-get/yum repositories?
</span><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
	There's a lot of red-tape involved in getting an  
	app into those repositories, and I'm too busy developing
	Waffles to bother with it. If you would like to become  
	a package maintainer and do it, that would be a great   
	contribution, and I would really appreciate it.
</div><br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
	How do I change the installation target directory?
</span><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Just change the "INSTALL_LOCATION_" variables at  
	the top of waffles/src/Makefile.
</div><br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
	How do I build Waffles on a machine where I do not
	have sudo or root permissions?
</span><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Just do "make opt" instead of "sudo make install".
	This will build everything, but will not install it. 
	You can run the binaries right out of the bin folder.
	Alternatively, you could change the install location 
	as described in the previous question.
</div><br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
	Why do you include the build dependencies for Windows,
	but not for Linux?
</span><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
	It is easy for Linux developers to get the            
	dependencies from package repositories. This method      
	is superior anyway because you get the latest versions.
	Windows users often require a little extra hand-holding,
	so I have made it extra convenient for them at the cost
	of linking to outdated libraries, etc.
</div><br><br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">
	How do I debug a Waffles app with KDevelop?
</span><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
	In KDevelop4, go to "Project-&gt;Open/Import Project". Choose the Makefile for the app you want to debug.
	Next, go to "Run-&gt;Configure Launches". Click on the name of the app. Click on the green plus sign. Specify the right executable binary.
	(The executable binary is in the bin folder, not the src folder. Use the binary that ends with "dbg".
	The one that doesn't end with dbg is the optimized one. If you do not see a binary that ends with "dbg", then you need to go into the "src"
	folder and do "make dbg".)
