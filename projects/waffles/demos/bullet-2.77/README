Bullet is a 3D Collision Detection and Rigid Body Dynamics Library for games and animation.
It was not written by Mike Gashler. See the AUTHORS file. It is included in this package
because some of my demos depend on it, and binary versions of the Bullet libraries are not
yet conveniently available in the package repositories of the common distros. This may be
an outdated version. Be sure to get the latest version if you plan to use it in your
projects.
